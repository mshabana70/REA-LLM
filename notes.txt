interactive job and then debug the container.

add path libcuda.so ld_library_path

Server is running but not able to access the server endpoint on hpc

Able to run inference from local machine but fails to return response when run from HPC

Possibly talk with HPC on getting it running

using gpt-4 to generate training data for fine tuning

decompiled output that's broken and have the LLM generate source code thats better at being decompiled and comparing the results to the original source code.

Can recompile and do some fuzzing to see how similar it is to the original

Recompile a decompiled android app 

Give the LLM guidance on what was wrong, give it debugging symbols to target the wrong areas

During the training procedure you have access to the source code but the model doesn't see it. Use reinforcement learning to iteratively get it closer to the original source code
