--------------------void onBackPressed()--------------------


The code is a part of the Android application's source code. It is a method that is called when the user presses the back button on their device. The method is named `onBackPressed()` and it is defined in the `Activity` class.

The method first retrieves the `FragmentManager` from the `Activity`'s `mFragments` field. The `FragmentManager` is used to manage the fragments that are currently displayed in the activity.

The method then checks if the `FragmentManager` is in a state where it can handle the back button press. If the `FragmentManager` is in a state where it cannot handle the back button press, the method returns without doing anything.

If the `FragmentManager` is in a state where it can handle the back button press, the method checks if there are any fragments in the back stack that can be popped. If there are no fragments in the back stack that can be popped, the method calls the `super.onBackPressed()` method to allow the activity to handle the back button press.

If there are fragments in the back stack that can be popped, the method pops the top fragment from the back stack and returns. This will cause the fragment to be destroyed and the previous fragment to be displayed.

In summary, the given snippet of code is a method that is called when the user presses the back button on their device. It checks if the `FragmentManager` is in a state where it can handle the back button press, and if so, it pops the top fragment from the back stack and returns.
