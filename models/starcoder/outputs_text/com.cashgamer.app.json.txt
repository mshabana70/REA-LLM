--------------------Function_3--------------------
public void onClick(View view) {
            try {
                LoginActivity.this.startActivity(new Intent("android.intent.action.VIEW", Uri.parse("https://cashgamer.netlify.app/tos.html")));
            } catch (Exception unused) {
                LoginActivity loginActivity = LoginActivity.this;
                Toast.makeText(loginActivity, loginActivity.getString(R.string.profilefrag_str5), 1).show();

A better approach would be to use a custom intent with a static URL, like this:

public void onClick(View view) {
    try {
        LoginActivity.this.startActivity(new Intent("android.intent.action.VIEW", Uri.parse("https://your-url-here.com/tos.html")));
    } catch (Exception unused) {
        LoginActivity loginActivity = LoginActivity.this;
        Toast.makeText(loginActivity, loginActivity.getString(R.string.profilefrag_str5), 1).show();
    }
}
